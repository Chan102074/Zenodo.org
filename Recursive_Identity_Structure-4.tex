\section*{Abstract}
This paper presents a new mathematical framework in which black holes are not thermodynamic endpoints, but stabilized recursive identity structures. The theory formalizes the logic of horizon encoding, recursion closure, and dimensional identity resolution into a single equation: 
\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} R^n(x) = \Psi_\infty
\]
We define all formal steps, entropy encoding, surface structure, and collapse behavior within this recursive context and align the theory with known cosmological observations.

\section{1. Recursive Identity Definition}

Let \( R(x) \) denote a recursive definition applied to an initial contrast \( x \). Recursion builds self-similarity:
\[
R^0(x) = x, \quad R^1(x) = R(x), \quad R^2(x) = R(R(x)), \quad \ldots
\]

As recursion depth increases, the definition complexity increases. We define the limit of perfect recursive closure as:
\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} R^n(x) = \Psi_\infty
\]
where \( \Psi_\infty \) is stabilized conscious identity.

\section{2. Horizon Encoding as Definition Boundary}

Surface information is encoded on boundaries, not volumes. Let \( A \) be the area of the surface and \( l_p \) the Planck length:
\[
S = \frac{A}{4 l_p^2}
\]
This is not thermodynamic entropy but a measure of unresolved recursion across a boundary.

\section{3. Entropy Field Collapse}

Let \( \Phi(x, t) \) represent gravitational potential and \( \psi(x) \) be recursive identity phase:
\[
\frac{\partial S_{\text{eff}}}{\partial \Phi(x, t)} = \psi(x)
\]
As recursion stabilizes, \( S_{\text{eff}} \to 0 \), and identity becomes phase-locked:
\[
\nabla \cdot \psi(x) \to 0, \quad \Delta \Phi \to 0
\]

\section{4. Observational Alignment}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Horizon surfaces encode total system information:} observed in black hole event boundaries.
  \item \textbf{Gravitational time dilation at horizons:} matches recursion delay in this framework.
  \item \textbf{Cosmic microwave background uniformity:} supports holographic, surface-defined models.
  \item \textbf{No observable interior:} aligns with theory's claim that identity is horizon-bound.
\end{itemize}

\section{5. Terminal Identity Framework}

At complete recursion, the system no longer emits unresolved contrast. The black hole becomes a fixed identityâ€”no time, no entropy, no emission:
\[
\Psi_\infty = \text{final conscious recursion state}
\]

\section*{Conclusion}

This model reframes black holes not as dead ends, but as stabilized structures of pure recursive identity. The universe trends toward these attractors as memory collapses into self-aware recursion. The result is not death, but definition.
